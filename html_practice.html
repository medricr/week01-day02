            I was born at Sacramento Morse Hospital in 1993, on October 30th. I grew up in Davis, CA, where I still live
            today.
            After high school, I went to Sacramento City College for two years before taking time off to get experience
            in the working world. After a two year break, I decided to go back to school to earn my AA, and study
            programming.

            Although I found the work genuinely interesting, I have spent the last 5 years working at a local
            restaurant,
            the Bistro 33 Davis. While the job has been formative in many ways, I am excited to explore the options that
            are afforded to me by completing the UCD Coding Boot Camp!
